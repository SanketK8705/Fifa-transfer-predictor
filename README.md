 ⚽ FIFA Transfer Market Value Predictor

A full-stack Machine Learning web app that predicts the **transfer market value of football players** using multiple models trained on the FIFA 19 dataset.

🚀 Features

 Predict player market value using ML models
 Select **famous players** or enter **custom stats**
 8+ dynamic visualizations for analysis
 Model comparison:
    Linear Regression
    Random Forest
    Gradient Boosting (Best)
    PCA-based dimensionality reduction
    Classification into value categories (Low → Elite)

🖥️ Tech Stack

Frontend
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend
Python, Flask

ML & Data

⚙️ How It Works

1. Loads and cleans dataset (currency, missing values) 
2. Uses features like age, overall, skills, etc.
3. Trains regression + classification models
4. Applies PCA for dimensionality reduction
5. Displays predictions + graphs on UI


📊 Models

| Model             | Purpose            |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Linear Regression | Baseline           |
| Random Forest     | Better accuracy    |
| Gradient Boosting | ⭐ Best performance |
